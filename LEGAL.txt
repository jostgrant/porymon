Recent rullings by the US Copyright Office have stated
AI generated art, effectively, cannot be Copyrighted.
I am no expert, and do not know, nor will not claim
to know the legal implications of this -- if such
works are automatically entered into the public-domain,
if fair-use comes into play, or what if anything else
could / would apply. There's no real precedence that's
in-place at the moment and I'm sure there will be a
growing body of rullings that will shape the industry;
even a probable Supreme Court case over the coming years
to help define / codify things.

For the time being, this repo will remain unlicensed.
It is my intention to license this project under the
CC0 (ie: release it as Public Domain) -- but currently
, again, it's unlicensed. Please proceed with caution.
