# PORYMON
Porymon is a generated art collection of 'digital monster'; Born of the computer.
Currently, we use [Craiyon](https://www.craiyon.com/) -- formerly known as [dall-e mini](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dalle-mini/dalle-mini), to generate what are colloquially known as 'fakemon'. This is a general model and not really trained
towards Fakemon -- but the intention is to eventually have a more dedicated model and 'region' pipeline. Including some system to include evolutions. This is a ways out / pipedream territory atm, so don't expect it anytime soon. lol

If you wish to contribute to the Porymon project, **do not** share your prompts. We want to stay
away from any explicit mention and/or references to anyone's intellectual property. And too, any resulting Porymon should not bare strong / notable resemblance to any IP.
